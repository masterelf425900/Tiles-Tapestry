# Tiles-Tapestry
A html script that can help make a very specific type of collages.

## How It Works
- Add images one by one and give each a new size and position within the canvas
- Preview how your canvas looks
- Automatically puts new images in their designated position (Top left to right). if theres issues, you can manually fix by setting X,Y coordinates yourself. if you want to go back to auto-layout, just keep the X,Y input fields blank.
- Change the background color of canvas
- Pick your own canvas size
- Scale or shrink the canvas
- Add rounded edges to individual images
- Set the gap between each images in the collage
- export and import using specific project files
- lock individual images to prevent auto layout
- use templates for individual images and update them all at once

## Note
Some of the functionalities are quite barebones like zooming which feels really quite sluggish but they do "work".
