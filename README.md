# Tiles-Tapestry
A python script that can help make a very specific type of collages

## How It Works
- Add images one by one and give each a new size and position within the canvas
- Preview how your canvas looks
- Automatically puts new images in their designated position (Top left to right). if theres issues, you can manually fix by setting X,Y coordinates yourself.
- Change the background color of canvas
- Expand or shrink the canvas
- Add rounded edges
- Pick your own canvas size
- Set the gap between each images in the collage
